# FarsiType
a simple library for Farsi/Arabic string written in C++

## About
Hello.  
I decided to do something useful in my free time and I've to admit, I kinda needed a thing like this too!  
I'm using imgui made by @ocornut on a project and I needed to render Farsi texts. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do it for 2 reasons:  
- Farsi/Persian or Arabic languages are RTL which makes them reversed
- They have 4 forms for each letter, so computer can't find the right one by itself

So after 3 days of searching for an answer and ways to achieve this, I finally came here with my own library that uses C++11 (I would do it in pure C if it was me, but looks lke it's possible that easy)  
Hope you guys find this useful!  
If you found any issue or have any suggestion, feel free to create an issue for it.  
Also, feel free to contribute and make this better for everyone :)
